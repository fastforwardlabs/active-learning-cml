### How to use Active Learner?

1. First, select the appropriate hyperparameters - selection strategy, initial labeled examples, learning rate, and number of epochs
2. Click "Train" button to start model training
3. When training is completed, a 2D visualization of the embeddings will be rendered. For those who are unfamiliar with embeddings think of them as rich feature representations that are extracted from the 
layer that feeds into the fully connected layer of our model. We extracted this 
information (the embeddings) for the prototype to showcase how they change with each training round. 
Also, once the embeddings are rendered, the model performance on the train and 
validation datasets is reflected in the corresponding graphs 
4. The datapoints that require human labeling are overlaid on the 2D visualization as "to label" dots
5. Next, provide labels by clicking on these data points which then renders the image on the right hand side, label and click "Submit"
6. Train the model again
7. Repeat the process until you have achieved the desired performance

You can also reset the data and training by clicking on the "Reset" button
